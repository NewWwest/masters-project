# Datasets

The majority of datasets used in the project is contained in the reproduction package. Here we duplicate the information on the source of vulnerability data, as well as the datasets for used repositories in case studies.

Addtionally the code used to generate the datasets of repositories is provided if regeneration of themm is required.
