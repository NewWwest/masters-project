# Feature-based models

This directory contains files used to evaluate the Feature-based commit classification models on the mined features.
The majority is implemented in notebooks as much of the process is about experimenting with different parameters.

First, the datainvestigation notebook can be used to look into the mined features.
Second, the Evaluate notebook can be used to test the perfomance of different classifiers with different class ratios.
Finally, in FineTuning notebook one can select the best configuration of the classifiers and calculate predictions.
